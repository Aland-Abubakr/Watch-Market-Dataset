Luxury Watch Market Dataset Project

This project explores a comprehensive dataset of over 45,000 luxury watches, sourced from Kaggle. The dataset includes various features describing the physical attributes, pricing, and seller information of each watch, providing a valuable opportunity for data exploration and visualization.

Dataset Overview

The dataset contains 23 columns and 45,024 rows, including key information such as:

Brand
Movement Type (e.g., Quartz, Automatic)
Case Material & Bracelet Material
Year of Production
Price
Condition & Availability
Seller Attributes (e.g., Reviews, Listings, Fast Shipper, Trusted Seller)
Other specs such as Water Resistance, Face Area, Shape, Gender, and more.
Missing values are present in some columns, reflecting real-world inconsistencies often seen in online marketplaces.

Analysis & Visualizations

In the notebook, you'll find various forms of exploratory data analysis (EDA), including:

Box plots for comparing price ranges by movement or brand
Histograms to observe distributions of key numeric attributes
Cross-tabulations and pivot tables to uncover patterns between seller traits and product attributes
Use of Seaborn and Matplotlib for high-quality visualizations
